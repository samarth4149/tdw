##### Video Recording

# Overview

It is possible to record video in TDW in one of two ways: Internally, using a standard controller + build setup, and with an external video recording application. This tutorial will cover both of these options.

If you haven't done so already, we recommend  you read the documentation for [visual perception](../visual_perception/overview.md) and [camera controls](../camera/overview.md).
