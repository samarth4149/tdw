# Other image passes (`_mask`, `_normals`, and `_albedo` passes)

## The `_mask` pass

The `_mask` pass is similar to the `_id` and `_category` passes but all objects are the same color:

## The `_normals` pass

In the `_normals` pass, surfaces are colored according to their orientation in relation to the camera:

## The `_albedo` pass

The `_albedo` pass has only color and texture, as if lit with only ambient light.
